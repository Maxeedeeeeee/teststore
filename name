Can you code me a complex thing or tell me what to do ect, basically you have a login page which lets you register, login and have a profile section. then you are able to click a store which allows you to buy ranks called Vip, Mvp, legend, Custom the description for VIp is Rank with cosmetics and slight perks. Mvp description is Rank with cosmetics special announcements and slightly more perks, Legends description is A rank with many perks and cosmetics., Customs description is legend rank but with any tag you want vip cost 2.50$, mvp cost 5$, legend customs 7.50$, and custom costs 10$. When you click buy on the bottom of each rank it allows you to enter a giftcard but it's optional (make it so I can make my own giftcards thru the code) also hooks into the login system to allow this, and make it so when you click buy it allows you to enter credit card information paypal, or cashapp and when the purchase has been sent to my account (Let me link it to me account) give them the rank they ordered in Minecraft, and discord
